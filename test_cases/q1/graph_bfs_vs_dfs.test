# Graph where BFS finds the optimal solution but DFS does not
class: "GraphSearchTest"
algorithm: "depthFirstSearch"

# The following section specifies the search problem and the solution.
# The graph is specified by first the set of start states, followed by
# the set of goal states, and lastly by the state transitions which are
# of the form: 
#      <start state> <actions> <end state> <cost>
#
# /-- B
# |   ^
# |   |
# |  *A -->[G]
# |   |     ^
# |   V     |
